# Gif Search App

Welcome to Gif Search App, where you can see the now trending gifs or look up any gif using keywords.

## Features

- Gif Search App overall ir very responsive, it works best on a good internet connection to load gifs faster.
- "live search" - you don't have to submit your search - the app will look it up for you!
- User-friendly pagination - the page below loads even before you reach the bottom.

## Challenges I faced on the way of completing the project

- This is my first ever flutter app, so the biggest challenge I had to face was to understand how the app comes together without using the <div> and other components I am used to.
- I had to understand how the giphy API works and then had to understand how to even make the gif appear in my app.
- By completion of this project I got a wave of motivation to learn more about flutter and how to make even more complicated app than this one.

## What could I have done better

- Seperate UI from app's logic
- Test the app
- Make the gifs clickable and shareable
